# AI-Kiosk-Testing-system
A secure online exam system, inspired by Safe Exam Browser (SEB), featuring a backend web service for business logic and APIs, a frontend interface for exam management and user interaction, and a kiosk-mode desktop application to prevent cheating and ensure exam integrity. The system leverages AI for face recognition (identity verification) and real-time emotion/behavior analysis to flag anomalies and support final proctoring decisions.
